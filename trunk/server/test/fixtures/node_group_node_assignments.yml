# Fixture data is loaded directly into the database, bypassing Active Record
# and any callbacks we've defined.  As such these assignments don't trigger
# the creation of virtual assignments to any parent groups.  Only use this
# fixture in tests where the lack of virtual assignments doesn't matter,
# otherwise create the assignments in your test case.
